## Introduction

The task involved using the provided user stories to identify and resolve bugs in the code, while also developing custom functions to extend the application's features. The goal was to improve the application by writing code to fulfill specific functionalities described in the user stories, such as managing task details and their lifecycle, enabling theme customization toggles, and more.

## Additional features
- Task Validation
- Delete board button

## Challenges I faced
This was by far the most difficult project Iâ€™ve tackled. One of the toughest parts was managing localStorage data and ensuring accurate selection and manipulation of DOM elements. 
I was unsure where to start, so I began debugging by fixing syntax errors, then shifted to addressing logical issues in the predefined functions and importing the helper functions and initial data from the other JS files. 

Function implementation was also a challenge, as I often forgot to reference DOM elements, leading me to eventually organize them within an elements object. It felt like every time I solved one problem, something else would break. Testing came with its own set of mistakes, including accidentally deleting an entire board from localStorage.  

Recording the walkthrough added time pressure, making it hard to give the detailed explanation I wanted. 

Combining my limited UI styling knowledge with DOM manipulation, UI/UX implementation, and event handling was overwhelming and almost pushed me to my limits, but it gave me insight into real-world development tasks. It helped me hone my troubleshooting and coding skills. Despite the obstacles, it was an invaluable experience in problem-solving and working under pressure.
